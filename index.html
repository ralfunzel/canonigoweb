        <h3>What is cultural/religious discrimination all about?</h3>
        <p>Religious and cultural discrimination is the unjust treatment of people based on their religious beliefs or cultural practices. It can take many forms, including prejudice, violence, exclusion, and stereotyping. Prejudice frequently entails the unfair generalization and stereotyping of individuals from diverse cultural or religious backgrounds, leading to biased judgements. It may lead to exclusion from political, social, or economic opportunities, which would prevent full societal engagement. </p>

        <h3>Why there's a need to address it?</h3>
        <p>It is of utmost importance to tackle discrimination that is based on culture and religion as it violates basic human rights principles like equality and dignity. Moreover, it is essential to foster social harmony and reduce conflicts and animosity between different groups. The diversity that exists in society is a source of enrichment, whereas discrimination prevents us from realizing the advantages that come with it. Putting an end to discrimination has global benefits as it promotes tolerance, respect, and understanding among individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>

        <h3>What are its causes?</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ignorance and Lack of Understanding:</b> Cultural discrimination often stems from a lack of knowledge and understanding about different cultures. Ignorance can lead to stereotypes, misconceptions, and prejudice.</li>
                <li><b>Historical Factors:</b> Historical events, conflicts, and power dynamics can contribute to cultural discrimination. Past conflicts, conquests, and colonization have left lasting imprints on societal attitudes toward certain cultures.</li>
                <li><b>Media Influence:</b> Media plays a significant role in shaping perceptions of different cultures. Stereotypes and biased portrayals in the media can contribute to cultural discrimination by reinforcing negative stereotypes and influencing public opinion.</li>
                <li><b>Ethnocentrism:</b> Ethnocentrism involves judging other cultures based on the standards and values of one's own culture. This can lead to a perception of one's own culture as superior, fostering discriminatory attitudes towards other cultures.</li>
